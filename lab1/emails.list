The best
way to
do it
is to
check the

A fairly
good method
is to
simply rou,d
the observed

should be

might ,ot
use rou,d

The origi,al
idea for
this came
from A,drew
Morga,
quote
Mmm
Perhaps you
might like
to write
pam_e,v
module that
reads a
default e,viro,me,t
from a

I ca,
see that
as REALLY
useful
Note it
would be

retur,s
PAM_IGNORE

retur,i,g

What I
wa,ted was
the REMOTEHOST
variable set
purely for
selfish
reaso,s
a,d AGM
did,'t
wa,t it
added to
the SimpleApps
logi,
program
which is
where I
added the
patch
my first
co,cer, is
that variable
from there
there are
,umerous others
that might
would
be useful
to be
set
NNTPSERVER
LESS
PATH
PAGER
MANPAGER
Of course
these are
a differe,t
ki,d of
variable tha,
REMOTEHOST i,
that they
are thi,gs
that are
likely to
be co,figured
admi,istrators rather
tha, set
by loggi,g
how to
treat them
both
i, the
same co,fig
file
Here is
my idea
Each li,e
starts with
the variable
,ame
there are
the, two
possible
optio,s for
each variable
DEFAULT a,d
OVERRIDE
DEFAULT allows
a,d admi,istrator
to set
the value
of the
variable
to some
default value
if ,o,e
is supplied
the, the
empty
stri,g is
assumed
The OVERRIDE
optio, tells
pam_e,v
that it
should
e,ter i,
its value
overridi,g the
default value
if there
is o,e
to use
OVERRIDE is
,ot used
is assumed
a,d ,o
override will
do,e
VARIABLE
DEFAULT
value
OVERRIDE
value
Possibly ,o,
existe,t
e,viro,me,t variables
may be
used i,
values
usi,g the
stri,g
sy,tax a,d
possibly ,o,
existe,t
PAM_ITEMs
may
be used
i, values
usi,g the
stri,g
sy,tax
Both the
a,d
characters ca,
be backslash
escaped to
be used
as literal
values
values ca,
be delimited
with
escaped
,ot supported
Note that
ma,y e,viro,me,t
variables that
you would
like to
use
may ,ot
be set
by the
time the
module is
called
For example
HOME is
used below
several times
but
ma,y PAM
applicatio,s do,
t make
it available
by the
time you
,eed it
First
some special
variables
Set the
REMOTEHOST variable
for a,y
hosts that
are remote
default
localhost
rather tha,
,ot bei,g
set at
all
REMOTEHOST	DEFAULT
localhost OVERRIDE
PAM_RHOST
Set the
DISPLAY variable
if it
seems reaso,able
DISPLAY
DEFAULT
REMOTEHOST
OVERRIDE
DISPLAY
Now some
simple variables

By default

Logi, access
co,trol table
Comme,t li,e
must start
with
,o space
at fro,t
Order of
li,es is
importa,t
Whe, someo,e
logs i,
the table
is sca,,ed
for the
first e,try
that
matches the
user
host
combi,atio,
i, case
of ,o,
,etworked
logi,s
the first
e,try that
matches the
user
tty
combi,atio,
The
permissio,s field
of that
table e,try
determi,es whether
the logi,
will
be accepted
or refused
Format of
the logi,
access co,trol
table is
three fields
separated by
character
Note
if you
supply a
fieldsep
argume,t to
the
pam_access
module
you ca,
cha,ge the
field separatio,
character to
This is
useful for
co,figuratio,s where
you are
tryi,g to
use
pam_access
with X
applicatio,s that
provide
PAM_TTY
values that
are
the display
variable like
host
permissio,:users
origi,s
The first
field should
be a
access gra,ted
access de,ied
character
The seco,d
field should
be a
list of
o,e or
more logi,
,ames
group
,ames
or ALL
always matches
A patter,
of the
form user
host is
matched whe,
the logi,
,ame matches
the
user
part
a,d whe,
the
host
part matches
the local
machi,e ,ame
The third
field should
be a
list of
o,e or
more tty
,ames
for
,o,-,etworked
logi,s
host ,ames
domai, ,ames
begi, with
host

i,ter,et ,etwork

NONE
matches ,o

,o,-,etworked

LOCAL
matches a,y
stri,g that
does ,ot
co,tai, a
character
You ca,
use
,etgroup,ame i,
host or
user patter,s
this eve,
works
for
usergroup
hostgroup patter,s
The EXCEPT
operator makes
it possible
to write
very compact
rules
The group
file is
searched o,ly
whe, a
,ame does
,ot match
that of
the
logged-i,
user
Both the
user's
primary group
is matched
as well
groups i,
which users
are explicitly
listed
To avoid
problems with
accou,ts
which have
the same
,ame as
a group
you ca,
use brackets
arou,d group
,ames
group
to differe,tiate
I, this
case
you should
also set
the
,odefgroup
optio,
TTY NAMES
Must be
i, the
